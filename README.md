# bumbershoot
This repository hosts the source code for the programs described and analyzed at my retrocoding blog [Bumbershoot Software](http://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com).

Unless otherwise specified, assembler source (.s) is intended to be built with the [Ophis assembler](https://github.com/michaelcmartin/Ophis).

BASIC sources for the Commodore 64 will use the `petcat` conventions for special characters. `petcat` is available as part of the [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) suite.
