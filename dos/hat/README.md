# The HAT Experiment

This code implements the various programs I used in the Bumbershoot software article [HLLs in DOS: Exploring the HAT Function](https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/hlls-in-dos-exploring-the-hat-function/).

I have included some simple build and clean scripts in this directory, but to actually make use of them, you will need the following things in your path:

 * Turbo Pascal 5.5
 * Turbo C 2.01
 * A DOS-compatible version of NASM

This directory also includes the original `CLEVER.BAS`, which is of unknown provenance but also seems to not be represented on the net. It appears to be compatible with any extant version of BASIC descended from the original BASICA.
